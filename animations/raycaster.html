        <h3>Simple Raytracing/Raycasting.</h3>
        <p>This project is a simple demonstration of using data derived from a 2-dimensional coordinate space (distance from an object) and an assumption about its height to determine what the object would look like in a 3D view.</p>
        <p>Based on the example in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGKg6VbFBo&list=PLOjd6kFr4qADy5huf3Vzz0aNU41qXUU6C">this video series</a> but reimplemented in vanilla JS.</p>
        <p>Select the canvas to pass keyboard input: Left or A to turn left, Right/D to turn right.</p>
